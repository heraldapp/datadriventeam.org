## How We Can Help

We are always happy to talk to founders and leaders of startups to discuss their development processes. We feel we learn so much from these conversations. If you're looking to make the development process at your company be more data-driven and customer-oriented, we are happy to lend an ear. To set up a 30-minute chat, email us at [hello@heraldhq.com](mailto:hello@heraldhq.com) or feel free to [pick a slot right from my Calendly](https://calendly.com/jay-midtype/30min).
