# Herald

Neel and I are taking the ideas presented in this document and building Herald to [empower teams to take a data-driven approach to user feedback](https://www.heraldhq.com). Herald is the [best space for teams to collect, analyze, and collaborate on user feedback](https://www.heraldhq.com) because:

- Our Chrome extension, Slack app, Front plugin, and (coming soon) desktop apps work wherever your customers talk to you.
- With all feedback in Herald, effortlessly determine the biggest problems facing your customers, including different customer segments.
- Our customizable dashboards, Voice of the Customer report, Slack and issue tracker integrations keep your entire team connected to customer problems and reduce friction in reaching consensus.

We'd love for you to consider [Herald](https://www.heraldhq.com) â€” reach out and we'd love to help :)
