# Herald

Neel and I have taken the core ideas presented in this document and built [Herald](https://www.heraldhq.com). Herald helps teams consolidate, qualify, and quantify customer feedback to make data-driven decisions. It is the easiest-to-use solution for your entire team because:

- Our browser extensions, Front plugin, and Slack app work wherever your customers talk to you.
- With all feedback in Herald, one can effortlessly determine the biggest problems facing specific customer segments.
- Our customizable dashboards, Voice of the Customer report, Slack and issue tracker integrations keep your entire team connected to customer problems and reduce friction in reaching consensus.

We'd love for your team to consider adopting [Herald](https://www.heraldhq.com) â€” reach out and we'd be delighted to help :)
