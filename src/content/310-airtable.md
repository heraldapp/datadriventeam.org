# Airtable

Here is the [Airtable base that implements the ideas presented in this guide for a fictional company -- Rocket Rides](https://airtable.com/shr06odYkz7K3p81S). Rocket Rides is the worldâ€™s leading air travel platform: it helps pilots take people to their destinations faster.

This is a simple Airtable base with three tabs:

- **Contacts** - list of customers, including their contact information and business attributes.
- **Topics** - list of high-level issues, ideas, and problems that customers have provided.
- **Quotes** - list of individual quotes provided by customer. Each quote is linked to a Contact and a Topic.

Using the Airtable WebClipper (only offered in the Pro plan), it is very easy to add customer quotes to this base from various sources where you may get customer feedback: GMail, Intercom, etc. Even if you are not on the Pro plan, you can just add data manually.
