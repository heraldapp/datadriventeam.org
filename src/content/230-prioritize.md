# Prioritize Feedback Based on Business Goals

Feedback will be abundant, but it's important to recognize that you have limited time and you must prioritize feedback from customers most important to your business goals.

> You can think of this system as "listen carefully to only some of their users." Listen carefully, meaning capture all of their exact words. Some of their users, meaning deciding who is most important and honing in on that feedback.

## Who Should I Listen To?

You know your business and your goals better than anyone, and you must decide which customers can help you reach those benchmarks. Based on our conversations with founders, here are some common examples:

- Highly engaged customers
- Highest revenue accounts
- Net promoters
- Paying customers
- Churned customers
- Customers that churn immediately after onboarding.

Once you and your team are aligned on what customer segments matter msot, the next step is to prioritize feedback from those customers.

> We try to make all our customers happy; however, from a business perspective, we do prioritize the needs of our larger accounts and anything that improves the odds of closing new leads.

# Filter customer insights when making decisions

While it is important to log all customer conversations, it is typically not possible to address all open concerns.

In order to make your feedback actionable, you must have a system in place to filter it according to your priorities. Having a way to combine customer attributes (like: paid user vs. free user, active vs. inactive user, new user vs. veteran user, promoter vs. detractor, etc.) is essential to making this happen. This is how the qualitative data can be turned into quantitative evidence.

> The thing that our whole team is focussing on right now is how do we move people into the "very disappointed" if Sunsama went away category. We poll customers regularly, and we want 40% of respondents to get there. So naturally, we need to prioritize the needs of those that are close, maybe the people that say they would be "somewhat disappointed" if it went away.
