# The Four Step Process

In order to be data-driven about user feedback, software teams need to adopt a process that encourages and promotes it. In this section, we summarize the key components of a data-driven approach to user feedback, as practiced by some of the world's best software startups like Brex, Notion, Tandem, and more. The four step process is as follows:

<h2>1. Capture</h2>
<p>
Diligently capture all your user feedback. This will pay dividends as you iterate. We describe the mechanics of capturing feedback in the most efficient manner.

<div>
<h2>2. Share</h2>
<p>
Don't allow feedback to live in a silo. Share it with everyone on your teamâ€”engineers, support, product, everybody! And review it regularly.

<a href="/process/prioritize-feedback-based-on-business-goals">
<div>
<h2>3. Prioritize</h2>
<p>
"Listen closely to <em>some</em> customers." Pick the user segments that matter most to your business and double down on their problems.
</p>
</div>

<a href="/process/engage-with-customers-about-their-feedback">
<div>
<h2>4. Engage</h2>
<p>
Don't treat user feedback as a one-way street. Keep customers engaged in your team's progress< as you solve one of their problems.
