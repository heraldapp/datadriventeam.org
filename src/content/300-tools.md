# The Tools

In this section, we suggest some tools that can help you implement these best practices within your team. Picking the right software can significantly reduce the frictions of transitioning to a customer-driven development like this.

## Integrate customer insights with existing tools

Having everybody on the same page about what customers are saying can be a tall order. But there are plenty of ways to take that feedback directly to team members in the tools they're already using daily. This includes design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Framer, and engineering issue trackers like JIRA, GitHub, GitLab, Clubhouse, or Linear. It's important to build a culture for these teams to constantly care and pay attention to customer feedback, and that can be made much easier with these integrations.

If done well, it should fit neatly within all of your team's existing workflows.

_Note: this is not an exhaustive list, and it is a work in progress, but it is based on the processes we've seen be effective (even at scale)._
