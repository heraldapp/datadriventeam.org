# Implementations

In this section, we provide ways to implement the data-driven approach to user feedback.

## Airtable

Here is the [Airtable base that implements the ideas presented in this guide for a fictional company -- Rocket Rides](https://airtable.com/shr06odYkz7K3p81S). Rocket Rides is the world’s leading air travel platform: it helps pilots take people to their destinations faster.

This is a simple Airtable base with three tabs:

- **Contacts** - list of customers, including their contact information and business attributes.
- **Topics** - list of high-level issues, ideas, and problems that customers have provided.
- **Quotes** - list of individual quotes provided by customer. Each quote is linked to a Contact and a Topic.

Using the Airtable WebClipper (only offered in the Pro plan), it is very easy to add customer quotes to this base from various sources where you may get customer feedback: GMail, Intercom, etc. Even if you are not on the Pro plan, you can just add data manually.

## Herald

Neel and I are taking the ideas presented in this document and building Herald, to [empower teams to take a data-driven approach to user feedback](https://www.heraldhq.com).

Herald is the [best space for teams to collect, analyze, and collaborate on user feedback](https://www.heraldhq.com) because:

- Our Chrome extension, Slack app, Front plugin, and (coming soon) desktop apps work wherever your customers talk to you.
- With all feedback in Herald, effortlessly determine the biggest problems facing your customers, including different customer segments.
- Our customizable dashboards, Voice of the Customer report, Slack and issue tracker integrations keep your entire team connected to customer problems and reduce friction in reaching consensus.

We'd love for you to consider [Herald](https://www.heraldhq.com) — reach out and we'd love to help :)
