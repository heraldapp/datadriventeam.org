# Filter customer insights when making decisions

While it is important to log all customer conversations, it is typically not possible to address all open concerns. Teams often decide that they'd prioritize a certain type of user, for instance, paid, active users who are net promoters of your product. Having a way to combine customer attributes (like: paid user vs. free user, active vs. inactive user, new user vs. veteran user, promoter vs. detractor, etc.) with the tagged customer quotes allows your team to filter feedback for the segment of users you'd like to prioritize.

## Take customer insights to your existing tools.

Often, design and engineering teams find that referring to customer quotes helps them scope down the implementation and ship the feature faster by solving _real_ customer problems vs. grander, hypothetical ones.

Seeing customer problems firsthand builds empathy and helps design and engineering teams ship better solutions.

## Follow up with customers after resolving their issue.

Even if it's been months since your user gave you feedback about an issue, even if they have churned from service, follow up and let them know you have resolved the issue. And watch the magic happen: these customers will love your attention to detail. Many companies have seen neutral users become promoters, and detractors become neutrals. There are even example of churned customers coming back to the service.

_Chandan Lodha, co-founder at CoinTracker states in [a Userstand interview](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/tracking-every-customer-request-has-cointracker-tracking-usd1b-in-assets):_

> It's a lot of work to track all these requests but it pays huge dividends because people have an immense amount of loyalty if they are being listened to and heard. It's not common for a faceless company to do what you tell them to do. **We get really really positive feedback when we do this**: "Oh my god, I can't believe you actually built this feature, thank you very much". This helps us build very high customer satisfaction and retention. We've seen churned customers come back.

## Get everyone involved.

You can multiply the impact of customer-facing teams by giving the rest of the team to access to customer conversations and learnings that would have previously been siloed. It works best when everyone joins in tagging conversations: from customer support to sales, from product management to executive leaders.

It's OK to start slow here. This is a tough guideline to follow. But start with just one person or a single team first, and increase adoption as this data-driven approach proves its value to your organization.

## Tag every single customer conversation.

To be able to take a data-driven approach to analyzing customer feedback, it is important that every single customer conversation is tagged. When you selectively tag conversations, any decisions made on the basis of those tags will be susceptible to bias.

Again, it's OK to start slow here. Start with tagging a few conversations a week and scale up as the data-driven approach proves it's value to your team.

# How Neel and I Can Help

Neel and I are taking the ideas presented in this document and building Herald.

Herald [empowers teams to take a data-driven approach to user feedback](https://www.heraldhq.com). Herald is the [best tool for teams to collect, tag, share, and analyze user feedback to make data-driven decisions](https://www.heraldhq.com).

Herald is the best tool to implement a data-driven approach to user feedback because:

- Herald's Chrome extension, Slack app, Front plugin, and (coming soon) desktop apps work wherever your customers talk to you: from Intercom to Zendesk, from GMail to Front, from Slack to Zoom, etc.
- Our customizable Voice of the Customer report, Slack integration, and dashboards keep your entire team directly connected to the customer.
- With all your feedback is in one place, it is easy to see the things different customer segments care about.
- Herald fits neatly with your tool your team already uses: customer feedback can be routed to JIRA, GitHub, Asana, Notion, GitLab, Clubhouse, Monday, Linear, and more.
