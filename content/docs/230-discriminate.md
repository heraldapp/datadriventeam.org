# Filter customer insights when making decisions

While it is important to log all customer conversations, it is typically not possible to address all open concerns. Teams often decide that they'd prioritize a certain type of user, for instance, paid, active users who are net promoters of your product. Having a way to combine customer attributes (like: paid user vs. free user, active vs. inactive user, new user vs. veteran user, promoter vs. detractor, etc.) with the tagged customer quotes allows your team to filter feedback for the segment of users you'd like to prioritize.
