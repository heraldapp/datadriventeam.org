# Capture Feedback Diligently

Capturing structured customer feedback is a marathon, not a race. If feedback is truly fueling a startup's product development process, there should be an overwhelming about of input coming in from users every day. This is understandably daunting. But turning that feedback into actionable insights requires diligence. Every conversation, every message, every text should be fed into a repository of data about what customers are asking about. **That's why Notion has over 200,000 tagged interactions with their customers.**

> Feedback is the only way to objectively prioritize. We know what we need to build for the next 5 years, but sequencing can only happen by understanding feedback. <br />

## Every Conversation Has an Insight

Your customer-facing teammates meticulously work to delight customers by answering questions over email and chat. They take copious notes during user interviews. However, unless special effort is taken, it is hard to build long-term learnings after even years of these efforts.

First, the team must recognize and agree that every conversation has an insight. It follows then that the insight embedded in each of these conversations should be tracked somewhere.

There, we have a ranked list of features that people want, and for each feature, we have a list of all the people that have wanted it in the past year. It's nice for us to know the number, to have a sense for how popular a request is. This is key. For now, we just want to know how many people want something and who they are.

## How To Capture Those Insights

It's fairly easy. Just save the following information about every quote:

1. A brief, verbatim customer quote from an email, chat, video or phone call, etc.
2. The customer providing the feedback.
3. A sentence ("tag") that describes the root of the customer feedback.

:point_right: Sometimes, one conversation more than one insight. In this case, just extract multiple quotes from the full customer conversation and associate them with one tag each.

This approach is beneficial for a few reasons:

- Using a verbatim quote from the customer allows you to use the customer's words as leverage. It is a powerfully ally for convincing teammates and making data-driven decisions. Yes, often, the quote may lack context, and your team may need to follow up with the customer to dig deeper, but if a quote is captured, it is unmistakable that the customer said that once. Avoid paraphrasing the words of the customer if possible, as it opens up concerns about "lost in translation" issues.
- Limiting customer feedback to a brief, verbatim quote allows others to more quickly [review customer feedback](/d/share-and-review-feedback-regularly/).
- Keeping the feedback associated with a tag allows your team to easily see how often the same topic has been raised by multiple customers.
- Keeping the feedback associated with a customer has many benefits: it allows you to reach out to the customer should more details be needed, it allows you to [inform them individually when you ship an enhancement](/d/engage-with-customers-about-their-feedback/), it allows you to [analyze what problems impact what types of customers](/d/prioritize-feedback-based-on-business-goals/).

:point_right: The key to being data-driven is to meticulously capture these insights. Your team is already doing ~98% of the effort speaking with customers, adding the simple step of tagging insights, and getting them in one place will allow your team be data-driven.

## Tag Every Single Customer Conversation

To be able to take a data-driven approach to analyzing customer feedback, it is important that every single customer conversation is tagged. When you selectively tag conversations, any decisions made on the basis of those tags will be susceptible to bias.

:point_right: Again, it's OK to start slow here. Start with tagging a few conversations a week and scale up as the data-driven approach proves it's value to your team.

> If you have a lot of feedback, it's hard to parse all of that. As we grow and more users come in, it's impossible for all of it to come into mind quickly. We needed a system boils down every conversation to the core piece of feedback with the user.
