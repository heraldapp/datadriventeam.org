# Capture insights from customer conversations

Your customer-facing teammates meticulously work to delight customers by answering questions over email and chat. They take copious notes during user interviews. However, unless special effort is taken, it is hard to build long-term learnings after even years of these efforts.

_Daryna Kulya, co-founder at OpenPhone states in [a Userstand interview](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/how-openphone-is-dogfooding-itself-to-product-market-fit):_

> It's very important for us to get insights to the team. We think
> about it a lot. We care about it a lotâ€”getting insights from customers
> and keeping the team in the loop.

> We use Notion for our internal knowledge base and have extended it to include a board for customer insights. There, we have a ranked list of features that people want, and for each feature, we have a list of all the people that have wanted it in the past year. It's nice for us to know the number, to have a sense for how popular a request is. This is key. For now, we just want to know how many people want something and who they are.

The insight of each customer conversation can be captured with a fairly simple process. Save (1) a brief, verbatim customer quote from an email, chat, video or phone call, etc. and associate it with (2) the customer, and (3) a tag that describes the root of the customer conversation.

Note that you may extract multiple quotes from a longer customer conversation and associate them with multiple tags.

This approach is beneficial for a few reasons:

- Using a verbatim quote from the customer has the benefit of using the customer's words as leverage. It is a powerfully ally for convincing teammates and making data-driven decisions. Yes, often, the quote may lack context - and your team may need to follow up with the customer to dig deeper, but if a quote is captured, it is unmistakable that the customer said that once. Avoid paraphrasing the words of the customer if possible, as it opens up concerns about "lost in translation" issues.
- Furthermore, limiting customer feedback to a brief, verbatim quote allows others to more expediently review customer feedback.
- Keeping the feedback associated with a tag allows your team to quickly see how often the same tag has been raised by multiple customers.
- Keeping the feedback associated with a customer has many benefits: it allows you to reach out to the customer should more details be needed, it allows you to inform them individually when you ship an enhancement, it allows you to analyze what problems impact what types of customers. We elaborate on these points in the rest of the document.

The key to being data-driven is to meticulously capture these customer insights. Your team is already doing ~98% of the effort speaking with customers, adding the simple step of tagging insights, and getting them in one place will help your team be data-driven.
