## **Capture**

Be diligent about capturing all the feedback your customers are willing to give. This will pay dividends as you iterate.

## **Share**

Don't allow feedback to live in a silo. Share it with everyone on your team (engineers, support, product, everybody!) and review it regularly.

## **Prioritize**

"Listen closely to _some_ customers." Pick the segments that matter most to you and double down on their problems.

## **Engage**

Don't allow your feedback process to be a one-way street. Keep customers updated on your progress as teams are solving one of their problems.
