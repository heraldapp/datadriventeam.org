# How Neel and I Can Help

Neel and I are taking the ideas presented in this document and building Herald.

Herald [empowers teams to take a data-driven approach to user feedback](https://www.heraldhq.com). Herald is the [best tool for teams to collect, tag, share, and analyze user feedback to make data-driven decisions](https://www.heraldhq.com).

Herald is the best tool to implement a data-driven approach to user feedback because:

- Herald's Chrome extension, Slack app, Front plugin, and (coming soon) desktop apps work wherever your customers talk to you: from Intercom to Zendesk, from GMail to Front, from Slack to Zoom, etc.
- Our customizable Voice of the Customer report, Slack integration, and dashboards keep your entire team directly connected to the customer.
- With all your feedback is in one place, it is easy to see the things different customer segments care about.
- Herald fits neatly with your tool your team already uses: customer feedback can be routed to JIRA, GitHub, Asana, Notion, GitLab, Clubhouse, Monday, Linear, and more.

We'd love for you to consider [Herald](https://www.heraldhq.com) — reach out and we'd love to help :)

Let us know if you have ideas to improve this guide — we are only an email away at hello@datadriventeam.org.
