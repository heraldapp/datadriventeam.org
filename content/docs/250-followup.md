# Follow up with customers after resolving their issue

Even if it's been months since your user gave you feedback about an issue, even if they have churned from service, follow up and let them know you have resolved the issue. And watch the magic happen: these customers will love your attention to detail. Many companies have seen neutral users become promoters, and detractors become neutrals. There are even example of churned customers coming back to the service.

_Chandan Lodha, co-founder at CoinTracker states in [a Userstand interview](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/tracking-every-customer-request-has-cointracker-tracking-usd1b-in-assets):_

> It's a lot of work to track all these requests but it pays huge dividends because people have an immense amount of loyalty if they are being listened to and heard. It's not common for a faceless company to do what you tell them to do. **We get really really positive feedback when we do this**: "Oh my god, I can't believe you actually built this feature, thank you very much". This helps us build very high customer satisfaction and retention. We've seen churned customers come back.
