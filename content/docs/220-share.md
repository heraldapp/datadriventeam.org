# Share and Review Feedback Regularly

One of biggest problems teams face when it comes to using customer feedback effectively comes from the natural information asymmetry that results when only a handful of individuals talk to customers. Those teammates have a treasure trove of data about what customers want and it must be shared widely. Leaving it in a silo results means your most valuable customer insights are only available to a privileged few, and usually that list doesn't even include engineering—the team tasked with building solutions to customer problems.

> We try to let everyone build context around where the opportunities are in the product, what's some of the most important feedback, etc. We share high signal summaries of customer feedback to an internal mailing list that everyone on the company is a member of. The higher signal stuff comes from sales conversations when we lose deals, when we churn, or proactive conversations with customers who might be interested in new product areas (that we plan on building).

## Why Everyone Needs to Understand Customer Problems

Often, design and engineering teams find that referring to customer quotes helps them scope down the implementation and ship the feature faster by solving _real_ customer problems vs. grander, hypothetical ones. Understanding the right tradeoffs to make is impossible without understanding the insights coming from customers.

Additionally, seeing customer problems firsthand builds empathy from design and engineering teams. There is nothing more painful than seeing someone struggle to use the software you designed or built. Utlimately, this wll result in teams shipping better solutions.

> Our engineering team does most of the inbound support. As such, our customers always get quick and technically complete answers. It also allows the engineers to "feel the pain" of our customers. The amount of customer love that we can generate by going the extra mile is the kind of stuff that they tell their friends when they're starting their podcasts.

## Integrate Customer insights With Existing Tools

Having everybody on the same page about what customers are saying can be a tall order. But there are plenty of ways to take that feedback directly to team members in the tools they're already using daily. This includes design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Framer, and engineering issue trackers like JIRA, GitHub, GitLab, Clubhouse, or Linear. It's important to build a culture for these teams to constantly care and pay attention to customer feedback, and than can be made much easier with these integrations.

## Review customer insights regularly as a team

Knowing what customers are saying is not enough. Teams must make it a point to take time out to review the feedback they're getting regularly. This is the only way to spot emerging trends about your product and how customers are responding to it.

A good time to do this might be whenever you do sprint planning. This keeps your entire team in touch with your customers and incorporates customer empathy into decision making.

If a team reviews customer feedback regularly, new information in each successive review skews towards recent features shipped by your team, new bugs discovered by your users, and longer-term recurring customer concerns.

> The Flex Company also hosts monthly lunch-and-learns for their employees to share learnings from customers. Whenever decisions need to be made, we make sure we have people from the team who have had a direct line of communication with customers. Often time this will be a member of our Customer Success team.
