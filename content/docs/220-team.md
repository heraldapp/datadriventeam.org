# Review customer insights regularly as a team

Review the most recent customer feedback regularly as a team, perhaps whenever you do sprint planning. This keeps your entire team in touch with your customers and incorporates customer empathy into decision making.

_Nick Bushak, co-founder and CTO at Gem states in [a Userstand interview](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/how-gem-keeps-its-team-in-tune-with-customers):_

> We try to let everyone build context around where the opportunities are in the product, what's some of the most important feedback, etc.

> We share high signal summaries of customer feedback to an internal mailing list that everyone on the company is a member of. The higher signal stuff comes from sales conversations when we lose deals, when we churn, or proactive conversations with customers who might be interested in new product areas (that we plan on building).

If a team reviews customer feedback regularly, new information in each successive review skews towards recent features shipped by your team, new bugs discovered by your users, and longer-term recurring customer concerns.
