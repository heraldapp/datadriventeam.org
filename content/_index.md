Neel and I spoke with 50+ companies to figure out how they "make something
people want." This document summarizes our learnings from processes run at
customer-oriented companies like Brex, Notion, Gem, Tandem, and more. We are
chronicling the best of these conversations in our blog: [Userstand— how
innovative companies understand their
users](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/).

The ideas presented in this document can be implemented by scraping together a
set of processes around a spreadsheet :)
Product planning is a balancing act between: (1) **product analytics**—how your
customers actually use the product and (2) **user feedback**—what your users
tell you are their problems.

**Product Analytics**—how your customers actually use the product.

**User Feedback**—what your users tell you are their problems.

There are a multitude of tools that help with taking a data-driven approach to
product analytics, but not for user feedback. As a result, decisions made by
"listening to customers" are often biased by the loudest voice, recent
conversations, or "gut feelings."

Let us know if you have ideas to improve this guide — we are only an email away
at hello@datadriventeam.org.
