## Preface

Neel and I spoke with 50+ companies to figure out how they "make something
people want." This document summarizes our learnings from processes run at
customer-oriented companies like Brex, Notion, Gem, Tandem, and more. We are
chronicling the best of these conversations in our blog: [Userstand— how
innovative companies understand their
users](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/).

:point_right: The ideas presented in this document can be implemented by scraping together a
set of processes around a spreadsheet :)

## Problem

Product planning is a balancing act between: (1) **product analytics**—how your
customers actually use the product and (2) **user feedback**—what your users
tell you are their problems.

The key difference between the two is that product analytics is objective where as user feedback is subjective. There are also a multitude of tools that help answer questions about product usage. Ultimately, answering questions by looking at product analytics is a backbone of a data-driven team. However, while product analytics can answer a lot of what users do and don't do, they can't answer the why or why nots behind them. This can only be answered by asking the user - via user feedback.

With that said, as user feedback is subjective, it is very easy to introduce bias even if you're talking to lots of customers. Here are how some of the biases that come into play:

### Loudest voice

- Only the team members who talk directly to customers have a chance to shape what feedback is presented and reviewed. Often, these team members can present their own bias. Sales team will naturally bias towards opportunities to close new deals. Product managers tend to bias towards problems that align with a product vision.

### Recent Remarks

- When there is not a systematic way of recording and analyzing user feedback, teams can often get biased by recent remarks. If one gets the same feedback from multiple users in the same week, it may naturally heighten the priority/urgency of the ask. However, such an ask may actually be dwarfed by others that are more spread out evenly over a larger time period. Without a data driven approach, teams are highly susceptible to recency bias.

### Gut feelings

- Every product team has a vision of what problem they are solving and how they are going to go about it. If forced to ask, most team can come up with a long roadmap. Without taking a data-driven approach, teams may become susceptible to gut feelings and/or selectively listening to customers whose feedback align with that vision.

In this guide, we provide a solution to overcome these biases by taking a data-driven approach to user feedback.
