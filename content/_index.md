## Preface

Over the past few months, Neel and I have spoken with 50+ companies to figure out how they "make something people want." This guide summarizes our learnings from **processes run at customer-oriented companies like Brex, Notion, Gem, Tandem, and more**.

On a related note, we are also chronicling the best of these conversations in our blog: [Userstand— how innovative companies understand their users](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/).

set of processes around a spreadsheet :)

## Problem

Product planning is a balancing act between: (1) **product analytics**—how your
customers actually use the product and (2) **user feedback**—what your users
tell you are their problems.

The key difference between the two is that **product analytics is objective** where as **user feedback is subjective**. Ultimately, answering questions quantitatively by looking at product analytics is a backbone of a data-driven team. However, while product analytics can answer a lot of what **users do** and **don't do**, they can't answer the **why** or **why nots** behind those user actions. The best way to understand the motivations behind those actions is by asking the user -- by encouraging and nurturing user feedback. As we observed at many of these customer-oriented companies, when user feedback is an integral part of their engineering processes, it becomes the flywheel that empowers your team to pinpoint and solve the most important customer painpoints.

However, as mentioned earlier, because user feedback is subjective, biases can easily bleed in and disrupt good intentions even if you're talking to lots of customers regularly. Here are how some of the biases that come into play:

### Loudest voice

- Only the team members who talk directly to customers have a chance to shape what feedback is presented and reviewed. Often, these team members can present their own bias. Sales team will naturally bias towards opportunities to close new deals. Product managers tend to bias towards problems that align with a product vision.

### Recent Remarks

- When there is not a systematic way of recording and analyzing user feedback, teams can often get biased by recent remarks. If one gets the same feedback from multiple users in the same week, it may naturally heighten the priority/urgency of the ask. However, such an ask may actually be dwarfed by others that are more spread out evenly over a larger time period. Without a data driven approach, teams are highly susceptible to recency bias.

### Gut feelings

- Every product team has a vision of what problem they are solving and how they are going to go about it. If forced to ask, most team can come up with a long roadmap. Without taking a data-driven approach, teams may become susceptible to gut feelings and/or selectively listening to customers whose feedback align with that vision.

It is important to stamp about the aforementioned biases, otherwise, the merits of talking to customers can easily be washed away, and may even lead your team down the wrong path. In this guide, we propose an end-to-end solution that allows your team to take a data-driven approach to user feedback based on our learnings from customer-oriented companies like Brex, Notion, Gem, and Tandem.
