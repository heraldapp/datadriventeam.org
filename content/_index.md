## Preface

Over the past few months, Nilkanth (Neel) and I have spoken with 50+ companies to understand how they "make something people want." We are chronicling the many of these conversations in our blog: [Userstand](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/).

While each of the Userstand conversation focuses on a single company, this guide summarizes the collective best practices from **data-driven processes run at customer-oriented companies like Brex, Notion, Tandem, and more**.

set of processes around a spreadsheet :)

## Problem

Product planning at data-driven companies is a balancing act between: (1) product analytics and (2) user feedback.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Product Analytics**—helps answer questions about how customers use and don't use a product or service.

:loudspeaker: **User Feedback**—helps understand motivations behind what customers do and don't do.

The key difference between the two is that **product analytics is objective** whereas **user feedback is subjective**. Ultimately, answering questions quantitatively by looking at product analytics is the backbone of a data-driven team. However, while product analytics can answer a lot of what **users do** and **don't do**, they can't answer the **why** or **why not** behind those user actions.

The best way to understand the motivations behind those actions is by asking the user -- by encouraging and nurturing user feedback. As we observed at many of these customer-oriented companies, **when user feedback is an integral part of their development process** -- making customers feel that they are being heard and served well. This leads to a flywheel effect where users provide a higher volume of feedback, and it continues to provide their teams a steady flow of rich information that helps pinpoint and solve the most important customer pains.

However, as mentioned earlier, because user feedback is subjective, biases can easily bleed in and disrupt good intentions even if you're talking to lots of customers regularly. Here are how some of the biases that come into play:

### Loudest voice

Only the team members who talk directly to customers have a chance to shape what feedback is presented and reviewed. Often, these team members can inject their own bias. Sales teams will naturally bias towards opportunities to close new deals. Product managers tend to bias towards problems that align with a product vision.

### Recent remarks

When there is no systematic way of recording and analyzing user feedback, teams will get biased by recent remarks. If one gets the same feedback from multiple users in the same week, it may naturally heighten the priority/urgency of the ask. But it might dwarf in comparison to other requests that have consistently been made over a larger time period. Without a data-driven approach, customer-facing teams are naturally susceptible to this bias.

### Gut feelings

Every product team has a vision for the problem they are solving and how they are going to go about it. If asked, most teams can come up with a long roadmap. Without taking a data-driven approach, teams may become susceptible to gut feelings and/or selectively listening to customers whose feedback aligns with that vision.

## Data-driven approach

It is important to weed out the aforementioned biases. Otherwise, the merits of talking to customers can easily be washed away, and may even lead your team down the wrong path. Next, we describe a [four step process that allows teams to take a data-driven approach to user feedback]({{< relref "/docs/200-process.md" >}}), based on collective best practices from customer-oriented companies like Brex, Notion, Tandem, and more.
