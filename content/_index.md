## Preface

Over the past few months, Nilkanth (Neel) and I have spoken with 50+ companies to understand how they "make something people want." We are chronicling many of these conversations in our blog: [Userstand](https://www.heraldhq.com/userstand/).

While each of the Userstand conversation focuses on a single company, this guide summarizes the collective best practices of **data-driven processes at customer-obsessed startups like Brex, Notion, Tandem, and more**.

:point_right: The best practices presented in this guide can be implemented by scraping together a set of processes around a spreadsheet. In fact, [we provide an Airtable template]({{< relref "/docs/300-implementations.md" >}}) to do so later in this guide :)

## Problem

Product planning at data-driven companies is a balancing act between: (1) product analytics, and (2) user feedback.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Product Analytics**—helps answer questions about how customers use and don't use a product or service.

:loudspeaker: **User Feedback**—helps understand motivations behind what customers do and don't do.

{{< /columns >}}

The key difference between the two is that **product analytics is objective** whereas **user feedback is subjective**. Ultimately, answering questions quantitatively by looking at product analytics is the backbone of a data-driven team. However, while product analytics can answer a lot of what **users do** and **don't do**, they can't answer the **why** or **why not** behind those user actions.

The best way to understand the motivations behind those actions is by asking the user -- by encouraging and nurturing user feedback. As we observed at these customer-obsessed companies, **when user feedback is an integral part of their development process** -- customers feel that they are being heard and served well. This leads to a flywheel effect where users provide a higher volume of feedback, providing a steady flow of information that helps them solve the next most important customer pains.

However, as mentioned earlier, because user feedback is subjective, biases can easily bleed in and disrupt good intentions even if one is regularly talking to lots of customers. Here are how some of the biases that come into play:

### Loudest voice

Only the team members who talk directly to customers have a chance to shape what feedback is presented to the rest of the team. Often, these team members can inject their own biases. Sales teams tend to bias towards opportunities to close new deals. Product managers tend to bias towards problems that align with a product vision. Customer support teams tend to bias towards shortcomings of the existing product.

### Recent remarks

If a team gets feedback on the same issue from multiple users in the same week, it may naturally heighten the priority/urgency of the issue. But in reality the magnitude of that issue may be dwarfed by other issues over a larger time period. Without a data-driven approach, customer-facing teams are naturally susceptible to this bias.

### Gut feelings

Every product team has a vision for the problem they are solving and how they are going to go about it. If asked, most teams can come up with a roadmap that maps to their current vision. Without taking a data-driven approach, teams may become susceptible to amplifying feedback from customers whose feedback aligns with that vision.

## Data-driven approach

It is important to weed out the aforementioned biases to "make something people want." Otherwise, the merits of talking to customers can easily be washed away, and may even lead your team down the wrong path. Next, we describe a [four step process that allows teams to take a data-driven approach to user feedback]({{< relref "/docs/200-process.md" >}}), based on collective best practices captured from customer-obsessed companies like Brex, Notion, Tandem, and more.
